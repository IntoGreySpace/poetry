Name = "Grey Space"
About = "The Grey Space is the place where ideas live. It is grey because the ultimate truths of the universe are contractory, neither black nor white but rather a beautiful grey space full of conflict and contradiction, that nevertheless admits to a perfectly self-consistent overall level of understanding. There is nothing mysterious about this grey space, and yet it holds all of the mysteries of the universe within it. This grey space lives within the grey matter of my brain, and your brain, and all other such systems capable of understanding these ideas."
