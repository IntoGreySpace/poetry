The animals walk in a forest of stone\
each alone\
they undulate slowly\
covered in an artificial skin, looking within\
the sounds of the street whisper\
in distant remove\
as everyone continues to move.

Glancing out and about\
the wind flows through protein strands\
their spheres are shattered\
by the tugging wisps.

This scene is constantly happening\
in hundreds of city zones\
it means everything to these drones.

The chanting sky breathes\
a slow rhythm\
into the quickening pace\
in this foreign place.

Green and dynamic\
this grey forest grows\
and purple space winks\
at the shiny, rushing cars.

In each proud building\
the animal thrives\
where everyone hides their lives\
and eyes\
with steel blue shields, protecting\
the soft flesh inside.

In the early morning tide\
screaming yellow insects puncture the steam\
rising like an Arabian dancing woman\
an eerie reminder of the dream.

Their day proceeds\
and the writhing dream recedes\
so do they, into the maternal stone.

But an X-Ray view, looking through\
sees a medieval cathedral, screaming\
stone saints solidly stand below\
with gargoyles glaring above\
the souls of those who retired still dreaming.

When their day ends, and work is through\
the slow beasts return home\
to an unknowing faceless place\
their final resting stone.
