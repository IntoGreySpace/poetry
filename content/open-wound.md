The open wound\
between the two\
once one

Once one knew\
the other would be true

But this one\
doesn't know what\
two do

When they become\
lonesome

Do they scab\
hard, thickness\
for speedy rehab?

Or wear red pain\
insane\
infected with tears\
that tear at fears?

In this situation\
I am found

With this sore\
I am bound\
to the one\
who once was too.
