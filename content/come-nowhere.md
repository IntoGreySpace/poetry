You've come a long way\
you've gone nowhere\
nothing has had its sway\
and you\
you're here to stay.  

You're windows have been soiled and washed\
stressed and pained\
polished and glossed\
and you\
you're here to stay\
...and the view gets better every day. 

Tomorrow is death\
yesterday was\
today, is -- so take a deep breath. 

Tomorrow looks great\
yesterday was\
today, is -- no need to wait. 

You've come a long way\
you've gone nowhere\
and yet, 

somehow, 

you're here.
