You want to know who you really are?\
You don't have to look far\
just take a leak\
or cut a vein

You'll quickly see the truth\
75% water is what you are\
sloshing around in a big old bag

The rest is not much better\
just some lipid sandos and steaks\
I guess that's all it takes.

How is it possible\
for this slippery mess\
to be the source\
of so much distress?

Seriously, everyone should just relax\
and enjoy your day at the beach\
lounging in the warm surf\
inside your hide.

Yep, that's just what I'm going to do\
once I'm done writing \
these fraught words

Oh I wish it were so\
but I'm still me\
so on we go!

## Note

While the brain is 75% water, the body is roughly 60%, and that can be highly variable across individuals. But the brain is all that matters anyway, and 75% is a much cooler number than "approximately 60".
