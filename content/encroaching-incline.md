Reading the papers each night\
makes me feel we're doing things right.\
The beautiful, secret message\
written between words\
of murder and war.

We struggle forward\
from the pottery ruins\
and ancient runes\
to an ever-widening mass\
of this mindless human dance.

The places we came from\
littered with the simple tools\
of a simple people\
who faced a world every bit as complex\
as the labyrinthine megapolex\
where tools are driving human slaves\
with robot-arm staves.

The individual subsumed\
in a blind, masterless plan\
each of us an unwitting tool.\
We govern ourselves\
regulate ourselves\
think for ourselves\
and so\
we fool ourselves\
into thinking we are free.

Our minds, made of independent cells\
each, thinking for themselves\
simple thoughts.\
Like them, we each think\
simple thoughts\
and act simple plays.

But the body public\
watching with unseen eyes\
upon our simple guise\
laughs at our pretension\
and lack of apprehension.

This global view reveals\
a growing, flowing ooze\
filling every nook and groove.\
Our steel and glass skeletons\
rising, like coral sea colonies.\
We, as they, build a solid reminder\
of the magic, fleeting times.

This massive incoming tide\
each pulsing wave advancing and receding\
yet we cannot read these words\
written in text so large.\
We see only waves of war\
murder, and hate.

These waves roll in each morning\
as yelling headlines report\
leaving foamy confusion in our minds\
we do not see\
with the eyes of time\
the encroaching of an incline.
