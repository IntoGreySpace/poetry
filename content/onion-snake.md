I wonder what is wrong\
as I have all along\
is it me, or was it her?

The desire piles up higher\
as the needs grow like weeds\
is this fertile union\
an onion or a snake?

If it is an onion\
then I peel away the layers\
with each fight or run-in\
and the fresh smell\
feeds my weary tears\
again and again.

If it is a snake\
then it slips through the weeds\
shedding skin which stays behind\
that's why these snakes\
are so hard to find.

I just wish it weren't so hard\
to tell the onion from the snake\
when the evidence is as thin\
as yesterday's dried-up skin.
