History will laugh at us\
with our own mouths, and minds.\
These proud, self-proclaimed progeny of ignorance\
from time in-memorial\
up-holding their brains\
as sacred and inviolate boxes\
of magic and soul.

I am these people\
but I have given in.\
I have surrendered\
to the great and eternal void\
and I have been rewarded\
with the keys to my own home\
a place where most are afraid\
to settle into\
to accept.

The price was my nonexistent soul\
borne of illusion and terror.\
The reward was Life\
and a trip along the asymptote of freedom.

I am angry\
I am alone.\
I am sitting in a room, pointing\
at the things which only I can see\
and they laugh at me.

Of course I'm mad at them.\
They are pompous with anxiety\
and whimpering with the courage of the masses.

Stop running\
there is no place to hide!\
Turn and face the beast\
who is brewing within\
turning your inside\
leaking out all over the floor.

Everyone can see the simple mask\
a crude implement\
and the breathing always gives you away.

It is difficult to see out\
from behind these grey veils\
which, like the fool and his shadow\
we constantly swerve to hide behind.

You lurk there, in full view\
as embarrassed and silly as can be\
hiding from yourself\
and me.

Don't worry, no one else is watching.\
no one else can see.\
As worry builds a fog\
you are cloaked in blind safety\
until I peer straight through!

Spikes, armor, thick fur, hair\
and, finally\
naked skin.\
The mask has been decaying for aeons\
we shall all watch, as it falls\
quietly\
to the floor.

The journey of innocence\
through solitary thorns\
to the field of lambs.
