The simultaneity of rain\
waves of water impinging\
on the ripples of my brain

The parallelism of wind\
waves of trees undulating\
over the ripples of the hills

The waves of cars crawling\
on the distant freeway carrying\
tenthousand simultaneous thoughts

Each thought a thousand waves\
of electric spikes, spreading\
over the rolling grey mass

The simulteneity of thought\
disguised as a rolling train

As I stand in the falling rain\
drops pounding and dissolving

A mirage of singularity\
in the vast, parallel universe

As am I.
