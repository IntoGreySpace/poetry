The feeling I get\
when I look inside the wet,\
stormy grey, on a rainy day

Its the terror of knowing\
and the anxiety of not\
knots, turning the sea\
inside of me

I think I know\
for only I ever can\
but I know also\
that you know too

I play a silly song\
and I fear what you know\
as I pound out the sounds\
I realize I cannot

Now, I try to return\
to the quiet, inner helm\
lord of a familiar realm

Only, I fear, as I steer\
that there's nothing there\
instead of beauty, breathing\
I ponder the mundane

A huge, greasy cheeseburger\
in a wicker basket, with fries\
flashes in my inner eyes

Followed quick by a noisy ad\
rhyming tunes, not mythic runes

Later, I gather my scattered thoughts\
looking in relief at the train\
lying peacefully on the shoulder\
derailed by the fateful boulder

Ignorance must precede knowledge\
and somehow submit\
to his advances, mounting...

But this steed hides in the high grass\
approaching like a feeling\
you never know when it started\
or when it will end

(beyond our control\
within our grasp\
inside our minds\
our essence\
knowledge).
