The essence of creativity\
is a boredom with the familiar\
and a tolerance for the indefinite\
with a longing for stability.

Cruel world, but nice lawns for the dead\
I say, more nice mental lawns for the living!\
Mow that shit, homies\
clean out the cobwebs\
wake up\
get with the program\
open your fucking eyes and scream out\
in the terror which confronts you every morning\
in the bathroom mirror.

Recognize the thin lipid veil\
covering the truth within you,\
keeping it from spilling out all over the floor.

It might have something to do\
with the symphony of cells\
playing the tune of molecules\
directed by a whisper\
guided by a suspicion of it all.

Maybe it has something to do\
with the epigenetic speciation of the lizard king\
who, in a nocturnal battle with the leech and the crab\
refines his being with a suit of armor\
spiked yellow and green

glancing askance at the other lizards who wait\
for the deliverance\
of a mythical truth.

Life is glorious peril\
where the only true path\
is the self-aware incorportion\
of peril into truth\
so that the snake eats its tail\
in a never-ending feast\
of the nothingness that is all.

The cloud of language covers\
the pure beam of crystalline vision\
which cuts through the fog of existence

Splinters of glass enter\
soft flesh unannounced and gradually\
make themselves known\
searching, pulling, tearing, pain of ruby shards\
burrowing deeper with each press of agony\
it is these glimmers of insight\
tainted with the carnal stain\
that drip into our sleeping waters\
looking for unprotected lizards lounging\
on the rocks of a tidal kingdom.

Process leads to endstates\
which are processes leading to themselves\
it is a foolish lizard who lounges\
on the rocks, waiting for it all\
to happen, for his anscestors did not wait\
to rise out of the waters\
and claim the primordial America.
