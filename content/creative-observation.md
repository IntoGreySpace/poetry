Living close, peering between\
the distal seem\
that joins the fabric of all.

Teetering on the blood-soiled boots\
pulling, strapped for time.\
I cannot pull hard enough to see\
that which has created you and me.

The demanding ruler, relentless\
punishing me for my quest\
seven thwacks at my behest.

Creative observation:\
creating, observing\
creating observation\
observing creation, one, two -- three.

The lovers argue and fight\
making love long into the night.\
and I sit, idly by\
strapped in for the whole flight.

The contentious rebel\
the dissatisfied bitch\
the fussy matron\
resisting every move\
constantly needing to prove.

Observing is simple\
perception flows like easy water\
cool, capricious, glinting\
a quick glance is all.

Creating is tough\
starting out rough\
with eyes without ayes\
squinting, grimacing\
chiseling away at the living stone\
growing.

Failure at eleven\
tune in, won't you...\
finally at twelve\
into something new we delve.\
restless at three\
(literally).

There is no sleep\
without waking first\
There is no day\
without that waking thirst.
