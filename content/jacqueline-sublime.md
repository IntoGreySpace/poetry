In a sense\
her innocence\
made sense

She had a sense\
she could tell everything\
past and present\
tense

Her love flowed\
in the present\
Her love flowered\
showering precious scents

She knew too much\
in a sense\
she'd lost\
her innocence

She knew me very well\
she could easily tell\
everything\
past and present

tense\
I'd feel\
until her kiss\
that I'll surely miss

Jacqueline is so sublime\
bathed in white robe\
and wine

She thought the hungry men\
were looking for a friend\
a place she'd often been\
her innocence\
was no pretense

Still, she cared and tried\
working, long and tired\
counting dollars and cents

And her greatest gift\
she gave herself\
to a part of herself\
selflessly

I think I see the sense\
of all this innocence\
when I see her life\
I see no reticence.
