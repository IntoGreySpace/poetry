The void is filled with tiny waves\
each wave a little packet\
building to a summit\
where, surrounded by the field\
a maelstrom of nothing rests\
insulated from the noise and heat\
touching only by inference\
moving on the path\
of least resistance

I'm playing at the edge\
of this tempting void\
dipping my foot\
in the eternity of silence\
that waits with patience\
for my solid stance

I crave the certainty\
that certain knowledge will bring\
I search and wait\
for those facts\
which will hold my weight

but then I know\
that once I do\
I will be looking out\
upon an undulating field\
strangely the same\
as the one I already knew

but then my feet\
will stand so strong\
that my desire to walk\
will with certainty, fade.

Knowing this now, I should act\
the moments are brief\
before the solitude is complete\
but something draws me ever in\
because in the center, I win

while no longer will I really doubt\
there will still be lots to doubt about\
when someone says I ought\
or didn't, or should\
that disturbance in the field\
will pull me here and there\
but always as the center

On my way in, I've been looking out\
for other centers, playing the field\
and this is where I've found\
that centers are not always round

The closer they get to you\
the more your fields push and distort\
pulling you apart\
the walls of vibration squeezed so tall\
without certain facts, one would surely fall

And so they fall, short of certain facts\
cowering in the waves of my reflection\
which look perfectly normal\
from the angle at which I stand

for a while I tried to shape my field\
vibes at different frequencies\
and phases I end up passing through\
hoping to tune in a friend\
in this unstable place

but the only stable mode\
is a standing wave, or absolute cold\
so I shake off those feelings\
with a deep breath\
I'm getting old

But old age loves company\
and the search continues anew\
first I reach out to you\
from this center where I write\
and then I tire and consider sleep

fighting gravity to unpack these thoughts\
from the crushing of the field\
is hard enough for me\
how can I ever send them to you\
when my waves push you away\
even as they try to draw you in?
