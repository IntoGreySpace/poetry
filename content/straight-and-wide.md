He jerks it left, then a hard right\
it swerves, dives, and recovers\
only to swerve, dive and crash\
head first\
into the ground.

I simply let it fly straight\
banking slightly when needed\
landing softly on the dry green grass\
at the midsummer's play field.

Sometimes, nothing much need be done\
the answer is straight ahead\
simple\
obvious.

They say we are descended from the apes\
yet we search for a meaning to our lives\
and not theirs.\
We are different, we say\
with the quiet shaking\
fear, an uneasy pilot.

We live, eat, and die\
yet we search for meaning\
and wonder why\
we are different, yes\
but still we tremble.

The answer to our deepest problems\
written in black vinyl relief, and grief\
as the rolling tomb disappears, disbelief.\
Straight ahead, we flinch\
from the clarity of the dark view.

Some swerve hard to the right\
going to church every night\
saving others from their plight.

Some bank left\
making pilgrimages to India and Tibet\
saving whales, seals, and mother earth\
from the future of eternal night.

Still others find salvation\
in power, greed, and money\
fighting constant wars of regret.

People don't want to go straight\
to face their faces\
in the mirror\
when mere animals look back.

We want to see\
a face, pretty or ugly\
at least its "me"\
not this beast always chasing\
my solitary spirit around\
hugging warm and visceral close.

If only they knew\
that it still would be you\
even if you withdrew\
into your fleshy host.\
Nothing is lost with the ghost.

The humor lost in all this confusion\
_On Any Sunday_, the people climb\
up the impossible peak\
sometimes straight is not straight\
when its up, one could go 'round.

The black person fights the same battle\
as the poet preaching death:

Red wine with red meat\
white wine with white meat\
black man with black soul\
darkness ever a symbol\
for the ignorance of night.

White man with pure soul\
white the goddess of light.

We think in unquestioned associations\
of church, school, and country.\
These bonds too low to fight\
we must dig them up\
and be prepared to recant\
our easy tune.

These jerking, twitching wrecks\
if you could just slap them a few\
in the face, they'd face\
the facts, but no.

The straight and wide path comes\
from the inner quest for proof\
an examination broad and deep\
resulting in a single, great truth.
