I could swear there's someone following me\
I turn...\
I see:

It's just a time shadow\
stretching out behind me\
an ever-narrowing river of former\
instants\
crawling back to that dark distant time.

Hallucinagenic echoes of spatial form\
rippling and gurgling\
quietly pursuing their ever-escaping spring\
not quite there, not quite not.

When I am here\
where do the former occupants go?\
When I move on\
what happens to the me I left behind?

In a panic\
I\
scramble\
to preserve

With photos and mutual experience\
but film fades and friends fail\
even pyramids are of no avail\
but one thing shall always survive ---

Reality itself\
and the impact it has\
on those that take the time\
to reach in\
and touch it.

(the fantastic glow creating\
a shadow of permanence\
in the river, flowing\
it's direction always showing\
the way we're going).
