There is something sad\
in a single loss\
of life\
or future wife.

But this sadness is lost\
on the great wailing sea\
of people dying\
and divorcing.

Each private tragedy\
acted out on a private stage\
sadness reigns forth\
like tenthousand stray puppies\
searching for scraps\
in a cold concrete forest.

Each day we revel in delight\
playing and making light\
there are tenthousand sadnesses\
now and throughout history.

For that one smile\
in a wink of time\
is that a crime?
