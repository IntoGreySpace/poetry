I float around in here, my soul adrift, constant\
Security discovered in terror, I face it all\
The view slips by, and I die every instant

Ravaged by fear and tugged by desire, a tiny ant\
In the colossal sphere where neurons stand tall\
I float around in here, my soul adrift, constant

My feet alight upon the fleeting moment\
Until it's swept away by the hurtling call\
The view slips by, and I die every instant

I knew not all this as an infant\
I knew nothing, I remember, I was normal\
I float around in here, my soul aloft, constant

Warm, damp, the pulsing grey begins to chant\
Beckoning, from the ominous bright pall\
The view slips by, and I die every instant

Someday I shall meet that precious recalcitrant\
Whose clock tells when my fate shall me befall\
I float around in here, my soul aloft, constant\
The view slips by, and I die every instant
