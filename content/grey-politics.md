(This is not a poem\
but a treatise\
in verse\
to subverse)

Politics is a balance\
twixt self and society\
freedom and equality.

As a paramecium,\
we drown alone\
as a eucariot,\
we slime on each other's shoulders\
building a fantastic beast.

No longer the cowboy,\
we must sacrifice\
for the common good.

But you are not me,\
and I cannot work for you\
we need our freedom\
to tease us upward.

So it's all grey\
each decision we must weigh\
absolutes are hobgoblins\
but what of morals?\
absolute rights?\
are these just men in tights?

Some things are easy.\
killing is always bad\
(except the evil dictator)

but what of drugs,\
which distract our cells\
but harm no one else?\
(directly, at least).

The fundamental problem\
is that we're all slimed together\
the individual is a cowboy myth\
and suicide is illegal!

Can we find universal compromises,\
global minima\
in this constraint satisfaction dillema?

Or must we judge each case\
with a scale balance and weights?

This is the challenge\
of grey politics.
