We swim in a warm red bath\
of pumping blood\
always eager to escape\
(note the urgent refugees who flee\
when you scrape your knee)

This blood swims within us\
trapped by a thin lipid veil\
as we stroll through a tranquil park\
on a sunny day, the way\
paved in blood, running through our toes\
like warm mud in the ebbing tide

This blood would drown us all\
were it not buried daily\
covered in pretty green grass\
which you slowly pass\
as you stroll by, thinking of the past

To the future, your thoughts do turn\
as your eyes alight upon a nearby urn\
these two thoughts brush against\
the hard, silent wall\
that stands betwixt, ever tall

The future you see\
is full of light, hope and progeny\
but this light does not creep\
into those eager secrets you keep

Think about them once\
and they engulf you whole

Think about them twice\
and they extract a greater toll

Think of them always\
and they let you pass\
into the gates of heaven\
on this great green earth.
