We are all hanging by a thread\
of DNA\
one little snip\
and you could be dead.

This thread is long\
stretching back through time\
the unbroken chain of being\
impossibly connected\
to us all.

This thread must be stronger\
than it looks\
We must be stronger\
than we know

When we need to survive\
to carry the chain forward\
we rise to the challenge\
this thread is everything\
in the end.

## Note

This was written about a month after my daughter was born with a very rare (1-in-10-million) medical condition caused by a unique random mutation in one of her genes.
