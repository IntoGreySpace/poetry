A barren, pale green overpass\
passes over, as empty as space\
the echoes of its passing recede\
as I speed into the night.

The hours of shadows and whistling wind\
spinning, churning, cleansing my mind\
the journey is a metaphor\
I can feel, encased in steel\
buried under the weight of that night.

The white noise of flight\
bathing me in sterile waves\
hiding the murmuring animals

If it weren't for their protein bulbs\
jutting above the seatbacks\
I'd feel completely alone, in flight.

I am left alone, in my space\
thinking about the sterile strangeness\
of all these animals, in a plane\
high, above the earth.

Looking down at the winking grid\
spread out, far below\
more of the same, I'm afraid\
of the people I'm very near to,\
letting go of my thoughts

thinking of their burial plots\
but I shouldn't since\
I hardly knew them\
that sterile night\
we journied together\
unknowing, into the future.
