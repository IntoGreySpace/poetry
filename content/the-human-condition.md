Skillful, quiet, all the masters paint\
their work carefully presented for the shadow and me\
most, blocked by the wall, make no attempt to see;\
and their arms blindly create. 

But one, confused by his own existence\
makes that crucial turn of the head, revealing\
the five faces of humanity teeming\
with their creators, staring indifferently back\
each different but the same. 

Across the broken road, divided\
the silent tools of mental evolution stand\
casting widening shadows in the light-beam of time\
with their swift obedience to the man in command\
who could prove his oblong head\
...a perfect cube. 

The viewer, watching\
from a well lit room\
in some living cement tomb\
at the final creation

Where matter melts tired threads\
in a well-knit web\
we're but a soft mourning's breeze\
rippling through the morning dew. 

The portent of a tired dawn-set\
at the start-end of the now-healed lane\
heralds the change\
that's been here all the same.

When one wonders from whence this all came\
a crack appears in the sky to reveal\
the blazing secret of reality...\
when two get together, there's really three! 

"Oh, but what does this mean to me?"
