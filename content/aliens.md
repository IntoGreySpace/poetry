Is there anyone else\
who doesn't need to wait\
for the aliens to come?

To see the people on this planet\
crawling like alien insects\
invading native lands\
with their all-terrain vehicles

To see the brains of these strangers,\
myself among them\
crawling like alien germs\
in grey confines

To see the horrible red blood\
oozing from murdered bodies\
and fallen warriors

Is green that much stranger?

It is already as strange as it gets!

All the perspective we need\
is no further away\
than arms length!

The infinite universe is\
just a clear night away

When the aliens come\
they will say\
"take me to your leader"

What if they're already here\
in my mind\
who should I take them to?

What leader will greet them\
with the same awe that I feel?

What leader will look in the mirror\
and laugh with green recognition!?
