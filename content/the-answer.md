His authority comes from nature\
His vision penetrates it\
He is close to the answer 

Their authority also comes from nature\
human nature\
Their vision is blind, backward, and destructive\
They are far from the answer 

One is immersed in nature, and has no authority\
One doesn't care to look\
He is also close to the answer 

The Answer sits on a white table\
Floating ephemeral above the terrain\
It just sits there, waiting for the able to find\
That for which they have been searching blind 

The mirror waiting to reflect the ultimate beauty\
Of a system able to see\
That half the Answer is Thee 

The candle white and pure, with a base of black\
Converting mass into energy\
And back\
For an eternity 

He is on a journey\
His destination and departure: The Answer\
His path is sometimes long, sometimes not\
Both happy and sad\
His di-vision guides him true 

One will always remain fixed\
For the answer he does not pursue 

They will they destroy 

...but what about the planet?
