The thrust of dim yearning\
awakened by a glance\
shudders down my brain stem\
backwards through time

My brain begins to seep\
swelling, with all those secrets I keep\
the urge of a sidelong view\
inside the tank top, you

And the tingle of an old feeling\
cresting on the rising flood\
of deep emotions, bound\
to the fresh smell of day

Some things I can see\
why they are a part of me\
where they arose\
--- things I chose

Others were always there\
like a good scare,\
or the thoughts that follow\
the sight of your stare

These dim thoughts within\
test a wall ever thin\
that holds them in

But when I try\
to let them out\
these dim thoughts are thin\
like they've never been

This makes people long\
for the wild carnal state\
filled with true lust\
and true hate

But for me the truth is as near\
as that fate I daily fear\
I love the life of thought\
even if that's all I've got.
