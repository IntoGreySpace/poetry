Name = "That Glorious Day"
Date = "1992-07-29"

First, humans and animals were the same\
siblings\
then, we encased ourselves\
in the center of the universe.

When this case was shattered\
we settled for a spot\
atop the great pyramid of life\
with an infinite distance between\
us and them\
like the Great Seal on green cash.

When this pyramid was connected\
we held on dearly, to that Eye\
that I, that held us high.

When this Eye is turned inward\
and we see ourselves as cells\
then we will rejoin the fray\
I live for that glorious day.
