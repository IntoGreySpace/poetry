We play the game\
of ever enough\
in the space between\
two people, pain\
and love

I pull you in\
and you push me away\
with a doubt\
for today

You begin your assault\
with my only fault\
for today

You say its worrisome\
I say its tiresome\
as I wonder\
will I ever be\
enough?

Is it a void you fill\
pushing, pulling my will\
as I wonder\
will I ever be\
enough?

I fill my void\
trying to fill yours\
as I scramble to cover\
the ills you discover

We push and pull\
in perfect harmony\
but will there be\
ever enough\
of you and me?
