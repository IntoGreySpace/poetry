I am terribly afraid.\
I am terrified of my fear\
I am quivering in my seat\
I am squirming the dance\
of a dead man dying

This is real\
there is no escape\
I am writing from the perspective\
of an insane person\
for I am crazy.

An insanity is just an inability\
to function\
to interact\
To pump the blood\
of the great social heart\
which is serviced in a warm bath\
of carbon monoxide\
colored pale, faint red\
in the daily pulsing sky.

I just want to be warm\
I am terrified of the cold\
I just want to be warm\
it is terribly cold out here\
(it really isn't so bad so far.)

I am liable to kill myself\
from shivering in a repeated\
spazmodic pattern\
across my body.

Suddenly, I stop\
as I transplant my mind\
into tomorrow morning, reflecting\
on this bizarre, panicked musing

The sound subsides\
and so do rides\
as the ground appears\
below my feet\
I alight with the pleasant sensation\
of words flowing quietly out my veins.

Misty clouds of light grey fog\
lifting brightly in the early dawn\
as the entire brain becomes\
a rapidly pulsing fuse\
sweating in the icy chill of panic\
the unknown sitting at my mirror.

"Who am I?"\
I write in perpetual wonder\
I suddenly think, insanely so\
that I have truly become me\
for all to see.

I must be a ridiculous, arrogant\
narcissistic and silly boy\
who suddenly has to deal.\
This must be why it is so nice to feel\
the warm hand of god, covering your\
wandering eyes.

"Turn and face the strange"
