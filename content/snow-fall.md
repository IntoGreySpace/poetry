When the snow started to fall\
I thought about the mystery\
of this slowly flaking sky.

I began to realize why\
old people want to die\
because I no longer stirred\
when the clouds began to crumble.

I wanted so hard to feel\
but my thoughts, like cold steel\
told me I'd seen it all\
before\
dark clouds, in my mind, began to rumble.

They tore open a page\
in dire outrage\
and the words started to fall\
as I thought about it all.

The long, cold fall.
