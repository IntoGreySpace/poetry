I find I'm always questioning\
answers I've known before\
tossed asunder\
as I continue to wonder

Why?\
Why?\
What?\
When?\
How?

Then, as now, I hold my breath\
always lurking in the backround,\
my death\
and between then and now\
what to do? when? and how?

I feel strangely empty\
void of direction\
incapable of erection\
and yet my life is full

Which just makes it worse\
that this curse has no source\
being propelled of its own force.

The reality of my awareness\
the awareness of my reality\
intertwined, and coated with fear

I wonder, is this poem provoking\
or curing, as I had hoped

Then, I think about the act of writing\
it feels good, I think\
I think, and it feels good.

Aligning my sense of self\
(which is always lipid thin\
otherwise I'd have\
something more to believe in)\
with the quest for truth\
feels good, provides proof

That I'm worth something\
that I can make a difference\
that I can at least\
talk to myself\
in a way\
that makes sense.

Again I wonder\
why I feel different now\
I think I had been somewhat asleep\
as the poetic record can attest\
my mind has been somewhat at rest

Now, for no good reason\
my heart is ripped open\
my mind awash in confusion\
when will I be over this dreaded feeling\
when will I return to normal\
sleeping.

I feel like running\
even though I know\
that facing is better\
(the straight path ahead\
and all that)\
but I've faced it already, right?\
Do I have to keep going through this\
every damn night?

The answer is process, and process I must\
I'll keep on processing\
until I'm just dust!

(If it doesn't kill me\
it will make me stronger)
