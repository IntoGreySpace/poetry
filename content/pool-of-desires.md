I splash about\
In my pool of desires\
where distant islands loom\
floating, ever closer\
in the whispering grey fog.

Each new horizon clearing\
the dim sleep\
of eternal waking.

I shrug off the past as easily\
as the present passes me by\
searching, swimming for that evanescent time\
when all will be as I want, all mine.

As a child, in a pool of plastic blocks\
endless combinations, endless wants\
I just sit and think, throwing LEGO's in a pile.

Presidents, Astronauts, Scientists, CEO's\
all wearing my smile\
dancing in my brain, playing with my pain\
sitting, watching water go down the drain.

Water is a viscous liquid\
blood more so\
but Life most of all\
and the harder you want\
the thicker it gets, until...

You cease to want, to try, to cry\
simply sliding by\
on the trade winds\
of daily toil\
low on oil.

One role, one goal\
one individual\
dedicate your life, they say.

And die having never been\
blind but for that point of light\
going quietly into the night.

"Not for me," he said\
as he blew a hole through his head\
...and the light slowly crept in.

"For me," I say\
as I work all day, thinking long into the night.\
Knowing the knower lessens the want\
knowing that life is good while wet\
but we always repay our debt.
