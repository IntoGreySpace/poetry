"They're running for their lives!"

An entire, hectic life\
spent running away?\
That does not seem the way\
to pass through the strife.

From whom or what do you run\
and where do you run to?\
Your angst will never stop\
the momentum of your ever-increasing speed\
fuels more, and She pushes onward\
in a frantic, breathless surge.

Squashed on the bumper, an insect\
trapped in the grill, a tasty kill\
you have no control\
She drives you where she will.

Her capacity for guilt, exceeded\
only\
by her ability to generate more.

The ghosts that plague are plaque\
in the mind, an active residue.\
You can't just reach up there and clean\
with brush and Gleem

You must reach out within\
turn, stop, face your fear\
Succumb -- you win!
