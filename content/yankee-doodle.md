The U.S. runner chases time\
tracing a path\
leaving behind.

Nuclear boy, strong\
in Her heart, pumping\
flesh, steam, and gasoline.

Splattering thin and warped\
Justice, from the armpit moist and warm\
emerges, and frowns upon.

Shedding sterile green light\
in the face of the night\
the Lady guides from below\
within.

Wispy, white, ephemeral\
spiritual George, over shoulders discerning\
backed by personified nature, and ideal man.

Looking back, they see ahead\
death, fear, anger grinning\
dripping fangs feeding poison stream\
etching a cavern wide\
in the sediment of time.

Help is reaching out, tearing us apart\
pulling ever back\
but no one can stop the running girl\
not even the hand of god.

The mask, hanging in celestial remove\
laughs with our own eyes\
upon our weary race\
and the man with the bat is there to face.
