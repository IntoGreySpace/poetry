The crowded elevator ride\
brings a smoldering quiet\
to the people, inside.

Each new floor filling\
a new corner, or wall\
like electrons in the void.

People are uncomfortable\
to have around\
in elevators and beaches\
but not at parties\
and speeches.

I always want to be alone\
until I am\
then I feel lonely\
and need people.

I don't usually find people\
that interesting, or neat\
because they're usually partial\
and incomplete.

They need people\
to fill a void\
left open, inside\
to share what's not really there.

So naturally, I want\
to be alone\
until\
I am.
